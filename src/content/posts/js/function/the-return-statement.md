## Return

- Functions in ECMAScript need not specify whether they return a value.
- Any function can return a value at any time by using the return statement followed by the value to return.
- a function stops executing and exits immediately when it encounters the return statement
- any code that comes after a return statement will never be executed.
- The return statement can also be used without specifying a return value
- in this way, the function stops executing immediately and returns undefined as its value.
- used in functions that donâ€™t return a value to stop function execution early
- a function either always return a value or never return a value.
