## CSS Properties and values

### When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a **CSS declaration**

### CSS declarations are found within **CSS Declaration Blocks**

### CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce **CSS rulesets (or CSS rules)**

### Shorthand properties

- `font`
- `padding`
- `margin`
