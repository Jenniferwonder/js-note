### CSS Overflowing Content

- What is overflow?
  - Overflow happens when there is too much content to fit in a box
  - CSS tries to avoid "data loss"
    - CSS overflows in visible ways
- The overflow property
  - `overflow`
    - `visible`
      - by default
    - `hidden`
    - `scroll`
      - browsers with visible scrollbars will always display them‚Äîeven if there is not enough content to overflow
      - `overflow-y: scroll`
        - To just scroll on the y axis
      - `overflow-x: scroll`
        - not recommended
        - recommend using `overflow-wrap`
    - `auto`
      - allows the browser to determine if it should display scrollbars
  - `overflow-wrap`
    - `normal`
    - `anywhere`
    - `word-break`
